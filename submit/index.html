            Submit amendments to the Public Suffix List
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to make the Public Suffix List as current and accurate as possible, we request that TLD registries put in place processes to keep their section of the list current and accurate. This will make sure that all sites within their TLD continue to function fully within modern browsers, in terms of the site owners' ability to set cookies and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, owners of privately-registered domains who themselves
            issue subdomains to mutually-untrusting parties may wish to be
            added to the PRIVATE section of the list.
        <p>
            The procedure to make changes is
            <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines">documented on our wiki</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Requests for changes to the PRIVATE section MUST come from the
            domain owner</strong> - we have this rule to make sure that domain owners
            are fully aware of the consequences of being added to the list.
            We will not make additions to this section if they are requested
            by third parties.
            Requests for changes to the ICANN section either need
            to come from the registry, or come with links to supporting
            official documentation.
